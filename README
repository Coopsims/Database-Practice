Welcome! This is just a bit of messing around with mySQL and learning how to set up and interact with databases in java, feel free to use it as a rerference if you are doing anything similar
This database was an atempt at creating a system that generated students schedules and linked those shedules to different teachers, but I didn't really get that far.
